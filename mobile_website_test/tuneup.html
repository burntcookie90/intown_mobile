		An "Intown" tune includes adjusting the gears, brakes, and bearings; truing the wheels; checking all the nuts and bolts; external lube; and a wipe down.

		We like to recommend this level of service. Since we put a wrench on every nut and bolt on the bike during a tune-up, we sometimes find hidden problems that may not be apparent in a less detailed job. Even if a particular component did not need adjustment, you'll know that it was checked and that it is in good shape.
